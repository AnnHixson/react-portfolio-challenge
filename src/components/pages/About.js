      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of UConn with a bachelor's in Cognitive Science. I am currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Developer coding bootcamp. In my free time I enjoy reading and playing games, both table-top and video. Recently, I've been playing a lot of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered on PC. All of the Spider-man pictures on this page are ones I took in the game's photo mode.
